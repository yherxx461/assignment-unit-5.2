    <!-- Create an unordered list with any questions you have -->
    <ol>
      <li>Doesn't the css file need to be in chronological order? How come the picture doesn't show if the header element is on top?</li>
      <li>How come the background color doesn't show on the main element? Do I need to put a div tag in before the main tag?</li>
      <li>I found the answers to my questions. The reason it doesn't show or display on the browser was because I kept ending each element in css with a "};"</li>
